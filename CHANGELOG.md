## 0.5.0 (08.03.2020)

- All `carapax-*` crates was merged into one `carapax` crate.
  Now you need to enable a corresponding feature in order
  to get access to features provided by those crates.
- Added `Dispatcher::set_error_handler` method.
  Introduced `LoggingErrorHandler` as default error handler.
  Now `ErrorPolicy` is available in public API.
  So that you can easily override error handler and/or change update propagation behavior.
- `seance` dependency was upgraded to 0.3 version.
- Added dialogues support.
- `HandlerError` now is a type alias for `Box<dyn Error>`.
- `CommandDispatcher` was removed, use `#[handler(command = "/name")]` instead.
- `#[handler]` proc macro emits a clear error message when function is not async.
- Value of `command` argument in `#[handler]` proc macro now always requires a leading slash.
- Use `TryFrom/TryInto` when converting an `Update` to `SessionId`.
  We must be sure that `SessionId` always contains `chat_id` and `user_id` in order to prevent bugs.
- `Command` type was moved to `types` module.
- Added tgbot 0.7.0 support.
